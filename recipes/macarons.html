<p>It’s never a bad time for dessert. Cookies, cake, pie, you name it! But sometimes you need to change it up with something a little fancier: enter macarons.</p>
<p>They may seem intimidating but with our easy-to-follow guide, they don’t have to be. And you can customize them! Want a variety? Use different types of food coloring. Prefer a different flavored icing? Add some lavender extract for a floral feel.</p>
<p>One bite, and you’ll feel like you’re in Paris yourself. </p>
